        <h1>Threats to Sea Turtles</h1>
        <p>Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the waters, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. However, in recent times, due to the quickly expanding human population, there have been new, intense pressures that have made it harder for sea turtles to survive. Five primary risks to sea turtles globally have been recognized by the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group: fishing bycatch, coastal development, pollution and infections, direct take, and climate change. Find out more about these threats and how you can assist.</p>

    <h1><u>FISHERIES BYCATCH</u></h1>
    <img src="images/kate-charles-leatherback-edit.jpg" height="100px" width="300px" align="left">
    <p>Thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles are thought to perish each year as a result of the fishing business. Turtles caught in gill nets, trawls, and longlines are discarded as bycatch. Additionally, the disruption to their food supply and environment has an effect on those who are able to evade fishing nets.</p>

    <h1><u>COASTAL DEVELOPMENT</u></h1>
    <img src="images/Dc_w_+people_highrises_(c)_Ted_Swoboda.jpg" height="200px" width="200px" align="right">
    <p>Because of receding coasts, sea turtle habitats are devastated every year. Sea turtle food sources and nesting areas are severely impacted anywhere there is boat vessel traffic, anytime a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and everywhere the sea floor is dug up and the beach erodes.</p>

        <img src="images/CCole_turtles08_b.jpg" height="200px" width="250px"  align="left">
        <p>Sea turtles are harmed by marine pollution in a number of ways. Sea turtles are harmed by ingesting and being entangled in waste such as plastic trash, fishing gear left out to sea, petroleum byproducts, and other objects. The immune systems of the turtles may be weakened by ocean pollution, which may also interfere with nesting habits and hatchling orientation.</p>

            <h1><u>DIRECT TAKE</u></h1>
            <img src="images/Caribbean_04_2008-231-Edit.jpg" height="150px" width="200px"  align="right">
            <p>Turtles are murdered all over the world and sold as unusual food, oil, leather, and jewelry on the international market. Millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been slaughtered over the past century only for the value of their shells. Even while efforts to promote conservation have resulted in a decline in the global trade in luxury and handicrafts, turtles continue to face danger in some regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.</p>

        <img src="images/IYORBank_CoralBleaching_TheOceanAgency_30.jpg" height="200px" width="200px"  align="left">
        <p>We are just now learning the extent to which climate change can affect sea turtles. Climate change can impact the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks, and can escalate the frequency of extreme weather events, which destroy nesting beaches and coral reefs.</p>
