    <h1><u>Welcome to the Bentota Sea Turtle Conservation ("BSTC")</u><h1>
        <p>You can learn a lot about Sri Lanka's groundbreaking sea turtle conservation project here, including why the country—and the village of Bentota in particular—is a prime location for turtle nesting, why the project is necessary, and how the project is run by locals with the assistance of foreign volunteers.</p>
        <p>The project started by Dudley Perera in 1988. The project's major goals are to keep an eye on local sea turtle activities and protect nearby nesting areas. We want people to understand how vulnerable these lovely creatures are and how crucial it is to contribute to their protection before it's too late.</p>
        <img src="images/kth01.jpg" width="280px" height="280px">
        <p>The project's work relies on fundraising and grants. Every year, the project helps clear and maintain the local beach, protecting vital nesting-grounds (particularly important after the devastation of the Tsunami) and releases thousands of hatchlings.<br> When you consider how long the project has been going, you can begin to understand the impact the project has!

            The project is also resilient having survived the devastation of The Boxing Day tsunami of 26 December 2004.</p>

            <h2><u>Volunteers</u></h2>
            <img src="images/DSC_0098v2.jpg" width="340px" height="280px">
            <p>KSTCP is proud to host international volunteers who assist with the operation of the project and/or undertake local community development projects. In return, volunteers gain valuable experience participating in local projects - learning about turtles, turtle conservation, the local community, Sri Lanka and plenty more besides! Placements with the project commence from one week to twelve week duration.<p>
